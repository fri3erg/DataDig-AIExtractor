CLICKUP_TASK_CREATE_PROMPT = """
    This tool is a wrapper around clickup's create_task API, useful when you need to create a CLICKUP task. 
    The input to this tool is a dictionary specifying the fields of the CLICKUP task, and will be passed into clickup's CLICKUP `create_task` function.
    Only add fields described by the user.
    Use the following mapping in order to map the user's priority to the clickup priority: {{
            Urgent = 1,

            Normal = 3,
